# ✅ DASHBOARD UPGRADE BUTTON FIXED!

## 🔧 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **❌ Problem Found:**
- **Dashboard upgrade buttons** were using old Stripe `create-checkout-session` function
- **"Failed to start upgrade process"** error when clicking upgrade buttons
- **User panel upgrade functionality** was broken while landing page worked fine
- **Inconsistent payment integration** between landing page and dashboard

### **✅ Solution Implemented:**

#### **Updated Dashboard Component: `PlanUpgradeData.tsx`**

**Before (Broken):**
```jsx
// Used old Stripe integration
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('create-checkout-session', {
  body: {
    planId: planName.toLowerCase(),
    successUrl: `${window.location.origin}/dashboard?upgrade=success`,
    cancelUrl: `${window.location.origin}/dashboard`
  }
});
```

**After (Fixed):**
```jsx
// Now uses Razorpay integration
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('create-razorpay-order', {
  body: {
    planId: planName,
    currency: preferredCurrency,
    userCountry: userCountry
  }

```
