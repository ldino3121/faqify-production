# ðŸ”‘ PERMANENT API KEY FIX

## Root Cause Found âœ…
The console shows **"API Error: 401 - Unauthorized"** which means the current API key is invalid/expired.

## Solution Steps:

### 1. Get Real OpenRouter API Key
- Go to https://openrouter.ai/
- Sign up/login
- Navigate to "Keys" section
- Click "Create Key"
- Add $5-10 credits to account
- Copy the new API key (starts with `sk-or-v1-...`)

### 2. Set Environment Variable
Run this command with YOUR new API key:

```bash
npx supabase secrets set DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-new-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Redeploy Function
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy analyze-content
```

## Alternative: Use OpenAI Instead
If you have an OpenAI API key, I can modify the function to use OpenAI instead of OpenRouter.

## Why This Happened
- The hardcoded API key in the code was from a previous user/demo
- API keys expire or get revoked
- Without valid credentials, all FAQ generation fails with 401 errors

## After Fix
- FAQ generation will work permanently
- No more "non 2xx status code" errors
- Production-ready functionality

## Cost
- OpenRouter: ~$0.01-0.05 per FAQ generation
- Very affordable for production use
