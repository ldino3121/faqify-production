# ‚úÖ EMBED DIALOG SIZE FIXED!

## üîß **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **‚ùå The Problem:**
- Embed code dialog was taking up the entire screen
- Copy button was not visible due to dialog overflow
- Code content was too large without proper scrolling
- Poor user experience when trying to copy embed codes

### **‚úÖ The Solution:**
- **Fixed dialog dimensions**: Changed from `max-w-2xl` to `max-w-4xl` for better width
- **Added height constraints**: Set `max-h-[80vh]` to prevent full-screen takeover
- **Added proper scrolling**: Code area now has `max-h-[50vh]` with `overflow-y-auto`
- **Improved button positioning**: Copy button now has `z-10` and proper spacing
- **Better text size**: Changed to `text-xs` for more compact code display
- **Added padding for button**: `pr-20` ensures copy button doesn't overlap code

## üéØ **WHAT'S IMPROVED NOW**

### **‚úÖ FAQManager.tsx Dialog:**
- **Proper Size**: Dialog no longer takes full screen
- **Visible Copy Button**: Always accessible in top-right corner
- **Scrollable Content**: Long embed codes scroll within contained area
- **Better Instructions**: Added helpful usage instructions

### **‚úÖ AdvancedEmbedGenerator.tsx Dialog:**
- **Larger Width**: `max-w-5xl` for advanced options
- **Controlled Height**: `max-h-[85vh]` prevents screen overflow
- **Scrollable Code Areas**: Each tab content scrolls independently
- **Better Button Layout**: Copy and download buttons properly positioned
